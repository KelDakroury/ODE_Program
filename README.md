# ODE_Program
This application constructs a corresponding approximation of the solution of a given initial value ODE problem

This application is solving analytically ordinary differential equations-initial value problems, it shows out the solutions of:
  ● Euler’s method,
  ● improved Euler’s method,
  ● Runge-Kutta method
  
The following is the initial value problem in the code:
  ● 𝑦′ = −𝑦^2/3 − 2/3𝑥^2
